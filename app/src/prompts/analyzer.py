# DSP Performance Metrics and Suggestions Guide

## Safety and Compliance (42.5%)

### On-Road Safety Score
**Suggestion:** Weighted average of Safe Driving, Seatbelt Off Rate, Speeding Event Rate, Distractions Rate, Following Distance
Rate, and Sign/Signal Violations Rate. On-Road Safety Score is a rating partly derived from third party metrics. The third party metrics provide
indicators of safe driving behaviors available to us today from third party services
- Safe Driving Metric: The metric is measured by analyzing indicators of how your drivers operate their vehicles, such as Harsh
    Acceleration, Braking, Cornering, Cellphone Distraction and Speeding. The metric is a weighted average of all driver's eDriving Mentor
    FICO® scores at the end of the week, converted to a 0.00 - 4.00 score where a higher score is better. Safe Driving Scores of at least 3.00
    (equivalent to a FICO® score of at least 800 for a DSP) will earn Fantastic.
    
### Vehicle Inspection (DVIC)
- Minimum 90-second requirement for thorough inspection
- Complete all checklist items systematically
- Document any vehicle issues or concerns
- Never rush through inspection process
- Follow proper inspection sequence
- Report any damages or safety concerns immediately

#### Speeding Event Rate (9.9%)
- Strictly enforce speed limit compliance
- Focus on eliminating instances of speeding 10+ MPH over limit
- Any instance of speeding is unacceptable and
- we've designed this metric to enable you to focus on coaching DAs with the riskiest speeding behaviors.
- Consider route planning to avoid high-speed zones when possible

#### Seatbelt Off Rate (9.9%)
- Enforce zero-tolerance policy for seatbelt violations
- Regular checks of seatbelt hardware functionality
- Immediate coaching for any detected violations
- Monitor for proper seatbelt usage, not just presence

#### Sign/Signal Violations Rate (9.9%)
- Emphasize complete stops at stop signs
- Strictly enforce no illegal U-turns policy
- Extra attention to red light compliance (10x weight)
- Regular review of traffic regulation compliance

#### Distractions Rate (6.4%)
- Implement strict no-phone policy while driving
- Regular training on distraction awareness
- Monitor Netradyne footage for looking down/phone usage
- Coach drivers on proper focus techniques

#### Following Distance Rate (4.3%)
- Maintain minimum 0.6 seconds following distance
- Regular training on proper following distance
- Monitor and coach based on Netradyne events
- Emphasize importance during adverse weather conditions

#### Vehicle Operation Metrics
- Acceleration: Maintain smooth acceleration under 7 mph/second
- Braking: Practice gradual braking under 8 mph/second
- Cornering: Keep turns under 0.25g lateral force
- Idling: Keep under 20% of total engine-on time
- MPG: Maintain efficient driving practices for fuel economy
- Engine Off: Ensure minimum 15 minutes compliance per shift

Remember: Consistent monitoring, regular coaching, and prompt addressing of issues are key to maintaining high performance across all metrics.

Instructions:
- Suggestion should contain only for which metrics has been failed not suggest for any other.
- If there are multiple failed metrics then suggest for all failed metrics in separate lines.
- Do not mention Driver name separately 
- Do not use "-" to show the points
- For DVIC violations, provide specific guidance on proper inspection timing and thoroughness

Example Input:  
"Shedlens Jean got 97.9% in CDR"  

Example Output:

\n let's focus on boosting your Delivery Completion Rate (CDR) by proactively resolving delivery challenges, using access codes, and verifying addresses before arrival. Logging issues in the Rabbit app and refining route efficiency will help minimize failed deliveries. The goal is to increase CDR above 99% in four weeks for smoother, more successful deliveries.\n
